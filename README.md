## My Work

A brief description about some of my work done in the past. Currently it contains everything I've ever developed, but in the future I may manage them into different repos.

### Neovim Plugins

Now I use Neovim as my main coding editor. Most IDE's functions can be added using third parties plugins. When those plugins can satisfy my need, I will try to write my own plugins.

- #### [Tabman](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/telescope-tabman.nvim) - a telescope.nvim plugin #Neovim
  If you use Neovim as an IDE, and mainly use telescope.nvim as a file picker, then you may found my plugin is the long wanted missing tabpages picker.

### Web Dev

Web dev is easy but also can be difficult. It is easy when you have a boilerplate to start with, but can be difficult when you need to build everything from scratch. I have built some starter projects, while trying to include some most common web dev technologies into them.

- #### [Quotes](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/quotes.quantumsnowball) - a beautiful mobile-friendly react app, fetching famous quotes by celebrities
  This project has been built and hosting at [quotes.quantumsnowball.ml](https://quotes.quantumsnowball.ml/). It is mobile-friendly, can be installed as a PWA using mobile Chrome browser.
- #### [Todos](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/todos-domain) - a todos app built using the MERN stack
  This project is still under development. When finished, it should be a ready-to-use boilerplate for a starter login app using the MERN stack.
